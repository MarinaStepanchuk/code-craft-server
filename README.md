### üõ†Ô∏è Run project

- "npm install": for install required packages

Warning! Especially for you to be able to run the code without searching for keys, I leave the .env file open.
OPEN AI uses keys which can be unilaterally blocked at any time if there is a suspicion of a leak. If you currently don't have the chatbot running, please replace the OPENAI_API_KEY key in the .env file with one of the following and restart the project:
